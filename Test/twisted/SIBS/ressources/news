| known bugs:   1) greedy bearoff does not work correctly, better    |
|                  not use it.                                       |
|               2) calculation of possible moves still fails in      |
|                  some cases. Don't use automove.                   |
|               3) in some cases, clients don't show the dice.       |
|                  To continue the game, you have to use the         |
|                  command 'roll' on the commandline.                |
|                                                                    |
