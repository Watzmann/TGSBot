Fibs-Help
  
NAME 
  about - Display information about the server 
SYNOPSIS 
  about 
DESCRIPTION 
  The about command displays some general information about the First 
  Internet Backgammon Server (FIBS).
  
NAME 
  accept - accepting doubles and resigns 
SYNOPSIS 
  accept 
DESCRIPTION 
  You can use 'accept' if your opponent has doubled and you think 
  it's ok to accept. Use 'reject' if you don't. 
  You can also use 'accept' if your opponent wants to resign and 
  you accept to win the number of points displayed. 
SEE ALSO 
  double, reject, resign
  
NAME 
  address - make your email address known to others 
SYNOPSIS 
  address <email_address>
DESCRIPTION 
  You can use the 'address' command to make your email address known 
  to other players. They can use the 'whois' command to get this 
  information about you. At the moment FIBS cannot check that this 
  is really your valid email address. You should however make sure 
  that the address you tell others is indeed valid. Abuse of this 
  feature can be a reason to delete your account on FIBS. 
  EXAMPLE 
  address marvin@fibs.com

  names, whois
  
NAME 
  autologin - how the TinyMUD style autologin feature works 
DESCRIPTION 
  The usual way to login is to enter your user name after the login: prompt 
  and your password after the password: prompt. There is an alternative way 
  of logging in that is used by TinyMUD clients and that is understood by 
  the server. At login: prompt you can send 'connect your_name your_password' 
  to the server. If name and password are ok you will be logged in without 
  seeing the password: prompt. Note that your password will appear as plain 
  text on the screen if you use this login method with telnet. 
  If you connect with this autologin feature the server assumes that you are 
  using a client with a separate input window (like TinyFugue) and will not 
  send those ' ' prompts you see when using telnet. This makes the output 
  look better (at least from my point of view). Autologin should not be used 
  when connecting by means of a telnet client.
  
NAME 
  average - show average number of users 
SYNOPSIS 
  average 
DESCRIPTION 
  The 'average' commands shows the average number of users, by time of day. 
  For each hour the output shows how many users were on average logged in 
  during that period since the last restart of the program. It also shows 
  the minimum and maximum number of users logged in during that time of day. 
  If there is no information available for that period (because FIBS was 
  last restarted less than 23 hours ago) the values will be shown as 0. 
  All times are in UTC (GMT).
  
NAME 
  away - Leaving a message for other users before leaving the terminal 
SYNOPSIS 
  away 
  away <message>
DESCRIPTION 
  If you type 'away message' everyone who tells you something or 
  invites you is told that you are away. The message you give is 
  shown after that. All messages sent to you will be displayed on 
  your screen while you're away. Nothing will be lost. You can use 
  the server as usual. It's just that others get the message when 
  they talk to you or invite you. Type 'back' if you are back again. 
  To remind you that you are away the prompt is changed from ' ' 
  to 'You're away. Please type 'back' '. 
  This command should be useful when your boss calls you or if 
  going to the restroom is more important than playing backgammon. 
  You can type just 'away' to see the messages left by all users who 
  are away. 
SEE ALSO 
  Back
  
NAME 
  back - Back again after the away command was used 
SYNOPSIS

  purpose. Bans remain active until you lift them or until you log out. 
  There is no way to save bans as permanent settings. 
SEE ALSO

NAME 
SYNOPSIS 
DESCRIPTION 
  The board command displays the board. As the board is displayed after 
  every move if the autoboard toggle is set to YES (which is the default) 
  you should only need to use this command if the board has scrolled from 
  your screen. You can only use this command if you're playing or while you 
  are watching another user playing. 
  You can use 'b' as an abbreviation of 'board'.

NAME 
  crawford - The Crawford rule 
DESCRIPTION 
  This server uses the Crawford rule by default. Here is what is says: 
  If you are playing a n-point match and your opponent is ahead 
  of you and he gets to n-1 points you are not allowed to use 
  the doubling cube in the next game to come. 
  You can set the crawford toggle to NO if you don't want to use the 
  Crawford rule. If your opponent did the same the rule won't be used. 
  EXAMPLE: 
  score 
  game # You opponent 
  .... ... ... 
SEE ALSO 
  double, toggle, toggle-crawford
  
NAME 
  date - equivalent to the time command 
SYNOPSIS 
  The date and time commands are equivalent. 
SEE ALSO 
  Time
  
NAME 
  dicetest - show statistics about the dice 
SYNOPSIS 
  dicetest 
DESCRIPTION 
  The dicetest command shows the results of several test that are 
  performed on all the rolls of all players after a restart of FIBS. 
  First it tells you how many rolls went into the results you'll see 
  afterwards. The next 6 lines show you how often each pair of numbers 
  appeared in those rolls. The next lines show a geometrical test: 
  Look at the book 'Numerical Recipes. Example Book (C)' for a similar 
  test. The next lines show how often it happened that a certain number 
  appeared several times in a row. Each roll with two dice is treated 
  as two rolls with a single die and the length of sequences of exactly 
  n rolls are counted for each number. E.g. the number below 'n: 1' 
  tells you how often there was exactly a single 1 (no 1 rolled before or 
  after that). In each line 'S:' means 'sum:'. The last line tells you 
  the theoretical values of the line above, so you can compare the 
  theory to the number of n-runs rolled in real life FIBS.
  
NAME 
  double 
SYNOPSIS 
  double 
DESCRIPTION 
  Type 'double' if you want to double the cube. Your opponent will then 
  be asked if she or he wants to accept or reject the double. 
  This program uses the Crawford rule by default. 
SEE ALSO 
  accept, crawford, reject, toggle-crawford
  
NAME 
  erase - How and why accounts are erased 
DESCRIPTION 
  I'm very sorry that this is necessary, but I can't wait any longer: 
  There have been problems with users of the backgammon server complaining 
  about other players. Complaints were about cheating and about insulting 
  other users. It's not possible for me to verify if those incidents did 
  really happen, because I'm not logged in all the time, because people tend 
  to behave well as soon as I'm logged in and because listening to all 
  players involved (which I tried) uses up a lot of the time I can use for 
  maintaining and improving the server. Therefore I have asked a couple of 
  players to report those incidents. Those players are users of this server 
  for several months and I know that I can rely on what they tell me. If 
  those players keep telling me that someone is misusing the server I will 
  erase the account in question without discussing about it. I know this 
  may not always be the ideal way to solve the problems, but I don't see any 
  other way to deal with them. 
  REMARKS 
  Don't complain if it happens to you - it's not my decision. No, I won't 
  tell who the players are whom I asked to keep their eyes open. I won't 
  answer the insulting emails I'll get. I won't listen to complaints about 
  other players by other players than the ones I asked to complain.
  
NAME 
  formula - The formulas used to calculate rating changes 
DESCRIPTION 
  These are the formulas used to determine the ratings of a player: 
  Let's say that two players P1 and P2 were playing a n-point match. 
  The ratings of the players are r1 for P1 and r2 for P2 . 
  Let D = abs(r1-r2) (rating difference) 
  Let P_upset = 1/(10^(D*sqrt(n)/2000)+1) (probability that underdog wins) 
  Let P=1-P_upset if the underdog wins and P=P_upset if the favorite wins. 
  For the winner: 
  Let K = max ( 1 , -experience/400+2 ) 
  The rating change is: 4*K*sqrt(n)*P 
  For the loser: 
  Let K = max ( 1 , -experience/400+2 ) 
  The rating change is: -4*K*sqrt(n)*P 
  The 'experience' of a player is the sum of the lengths of all matches 
  a player has finished. Every player starts with a rating of 1500 and 
  an experience of 0.

NAME 
  gag - ignore what another user says 
SYNOPSIS 
  gag <name>
DESCRIPTION 
  If you 'gag' another user you will not hear what he or she says with 
  the 'tell', 'shout', 'kibitz' or 'whisper' commands. You can't ignore 
  what your opponent tells you ith the 'say' command or what the players 
  in game you watch 'kibitz' or 'whisper' (If you don't want to listen to 
  them, why do you play with them or watch them in the first place?). 
  You can't talk to people that you have gagged. 
  There is no 'ungag' command, just use 'gag <name ' again for that>
  purpose. 
SEE ALSO 
  kibitz, say, shout, tell, watch, whisper

NAME 
  hostnames - how to interpret hostnames given by the who command 
DESCRIPTION 
  Whenever a connection between your computer and the server is 
  established, all the server knows is the so-called 'IP address' of 
  your computer (e.g. 134.130.130.46). If your local network is set 
  up correctly the server is able to translate this information into 
  a more readable address (e.g. ouzo.rog.rwth-aachen.de). There are 
  two things that can go wrong: 
  o The server knows which computer is responsible for this address 
  but this machine says the address is invalid. In this case the 
  server gives you the name of the responsible machine by displaying 
  'near: name.of.responsible.computer' as your address. Please ask 
  your local network guru to add your machine to the name server 
  database. (You can find out your IP address with the 'where' command) 
  o The server can't find a computer responsible for your IP address. 
  In this case it displays 'Illegal IP' in front of your address. 
  Probably there is something wrong in the way your computer was 
  installed. Please ask your local system administrator to check 
  if your computer uses the correct IP address. It is possible that 
  the server won't accept connections from those machines in the future.

NAME 
  invite - invite another user to play a game of backgammon 
SYNOPSIS 
  invite <name <number>
  invite <name unlimited>
  invite <name>
DESCRIPTION 
  The 'invite' command is used to ask other players if they want to play 
  with you. You can only use this command if you are ready to play (see 
  'toggle ready'), the other player is ready to play and is not already 
  playing with someone else. See help on 'who' to find out whom you can 
  invite. There are three ways to invite other players (see above) 
  The first two of the above discard a saved game if <player accepts the>
  invitation, but <player is told that there is a saved>match. 
  Invitations for matches longer than 9 points are limited to players whose 
  experience is high enough to appear in the rating list. This was 
  necessary because some new players cheated themselves into the rating list. 
SEE ALSO 
  join, toggle, toggle-ready, who
  
NAME 
  join - accept an invitation from another player 
SYNOPSIS 
  join 
  join <name>
DESCRIPTION 
  You can type 'join <name ' if you get a message that <name wants to>
  play with you. If you don't want to play just do nothing. After joining 
  the player who invited you the game starts immediately. See help on 
  'leave' if you don't know how to stop a game. 
  'join' without arguments is used to start a new game within a match. 
  If one of the players is watching the server will automatically do 
  an unwatch command for this player. 
SEE ALSO 
  invite, leave, watch, unwatch
  
NAME 
  kibitz - talking to players and watchers 
SYNOPSIS 
  kibitz <message>
DESCRIPTION 
  The 'kibitz' command is similar to the 'say' command. If you are 
  playing or watching a game use 'kibitz <message ' to say <message>
  to everyone who is playing or watching the game. You can use the 
  single letter 'k' as an abbreviation of 'kibitz'. 
  If you only want to talk to the watchers of the game (because you 
  don't want to disturb the players) use the 'whisper' command. 
SEE ALSO 
  say, shout, tell, whisper
  
NAME 
  last - Display information about login times 
SYNOPSIS 
  last 
DESCRIPTION 
  The 'last' command can be used to display the last logins and logouts. 
  The last 20 entries of the login/logout list will be displayed. 
  The command 'last <name ' is not available anymore. Use the>'whois' 
  command instead. 
SEE ALSO 
  Whois
  
NAME 
  leave - leave and save a game 
SYNOPSIS 
  leave 
DESCRIPTION 
  You can type 'leave' if you are playing with someone and want to 
  quit the game. The game is saved and will be reloaded when one 
  of the players types 'invite <name ' and the other player>joins. 
  It's not very polite to leave a game without telling your opponent 
  first. This feature should NOT be used to abort a match before you 
  lose and your rating changes. This behavior is cheating!! 
SEE ALSO 
  invite, join
  
NAME 
  look - Take a short look at a game 
SYNOPSIS 
  look <name>
DESCRIPTION 
  You can type 'look <name ' to take a quick look at <name 's>game.

SYNOPSIS 
  message <name <message>
  message 
DESCRIPTION 
  You can use 'message <name <message ' to leave a message for a user>
  who is not logged in. The message will be displayed to <name when she>
  or he logs in again. If <name is logged in while you send the message>
  she or he will also see the message on screen immediately. 
  If you just type 'message' without any argument you'll see the messages 
  that were left for you. You can also use 'message' without arguments to 
  read the messages left for you again. Every time you log out of FIBS 
  all messages will be deleted, so you won't see them again the next time 
  you log in. 
  As this command is limited to one line, this feature is for short notes. 
  If you want to write longer messages please use electronic mail. 
  Please note that name completion doesn't work for this command.

  Names
  
NAME 
  motd - Display the message of the day

NAME 
  move - Moving pieces on the board 
SYNOPSIS 
  move <from -<to>... 
  move <from <to>... 
  <from -<to>... 
  <from <to>... 
DESCRIPTION 
  The move command tells the server what pieces you want to move. 
  Each move must be given as '<from <to ' or '<from -<to '. As <from and>
  <to you can use the numbers between 1 and 24 and the words 'bar' and>'off'. 
  You can use ' ' or '-' to separate <from and <to . To separate moves you>
  have to use ' '. Example: 'move bar-5 bar 5 bar - 5 bar -5' moves 4 pieces 
  from the bar to position 5. 
  'move' can be abbreviated by typing 'm'. 
  'bar' can be abbreviated by typing 'b'. 
  'off' can be abbreviated by typing 'o'. 
  You can omit the word 'move' and e.g. just type '1 3' instead of 'move 1 3' 
  If your automove toggle is set to YES the server will move for you if there 
  is only one possible move. 
SEE ALSO 
  toggle, toggle-automove
  
NAME 
  names - name completion 
DESCRIPTION 
  For most commands that need a name as an argument you only have to 
  type the first few letters of a name. If you type 'tell ma Hi!' 
  and the only player whose name starts with 'ma' is marvin, the server 
  will do a 'tell marvin Hi!' for you. If there is another user called 
  'mama' the server will complain that you should greet either marvin 
  or mama. (Note that in this example 't ma Hi!' is even shorter and 
  that this feature does not work for the 'last', 'message' and 'ratings' 
  commands). The name completion will first try to find a name that 
  matches case sensitive. If this doesn't work it will try to find a 
  name that matches case insensitive.
  
NAME 
  off - bear off pieces with every possible move 
SYNOPSIS 
  off 
DESCRIPTION 
  Often you will want to bear off one piece per move in the final 
  phase of a game. If you have rolled a double you may want to bear 
  off 4 pieces, otherwise you may want to bear off 2 pieces. Instead 
  of entering the moves to do that manually, you can issue the 'off' 
  command and FIBS will bear off for you automatically if possible. 
SEE ALSO 
  toggle-greedy
  
NAME 
SYNOPSIS 
DESCRIPTION 
  If there is a saved game with a player called <name the board of>
  this game is displayed. Name completion doesn't work for this command, 
  so the <name has to match the player's name>exactly. 
  The 'oldboard' command can only be used while you are not playing. 
SEE ALSO 
  names, oldmoves
  
NAME 
  oldmoves - Display the moves of a saved game. 
SYNOPSIS 
  oldmoves <name>
DESCRIPTION 
  The oldmoves command displays a list of the moves of a saved game 
  with a player called <name . Name completion doesn't work for this>
  command, so the <name argument has to match the player's name>
  exactly. This command can be used to display games that are already 
  over and not displayed by the 'show saved' command. 
  LIMITATIONS 
  o You shouldn't wait too long before using this command, because 
  games that are saved but already over will be erased every few days. 
  o If you try to display the moves of a game you are currently playing 
  the last moves may be missing, because they are buffered before 
  they are saved. 
  o The output is a little minimalistic. 
  o Information about who is X and who is O is only displayed for games 
  that were started since version 1.198 of the server. 
  o If you start a new game in a match the last game will be erased. 
  If you want a list of it's moves use this command before you type 
  'join' to start a new game in the match. 
  o It's up to you to see the moves that scroll from your screen.

NAME 
  otter - Offering an instant redouble that is an otter 
SYNOPSIS 
  beaver 
DESCRIPTION 
  An instant redouble of an offered "raccoon" is called "otter". You can 
  use the command 'redouble' instead. 'otter' can only used for the 
  third instant redouble while 'redouble' can be used for any of several 
  instant redoubles in a row. 
SEE ALSO 
  beaver, raccoon, redouble
  
NAME 
  panic - save a game to a special file 
SYNOPSIS 
  panic 
DESCRIPTION 
  Use the 'panic' command if you find a bug while playing. 
  Your game is then saved in a special file together with 
  the names of the players and the current time. To find 
  the bug in the source code I'll need more information. 
  Send mail describing the bug in detail to: 
  marvin@rog.rwth-aachen.de 
  I hope you'll never use this command. This command will be 
  erased in the future because it isn't very helpful anymore.
  
NAME 
  password - change password 
SYNOPSIS 
  password <old :<new :<new>
DESCRIPTION 
  The password command can be used to change your password. 
  You have to give your new password twice to avoid typos. 
  The password will appear on the screen while you type it! 
  Make sure that nobody is looking at your screen while you 
  change your password. If the 'cls' command works on your 
  terminal it's a good idea to use it right after changing 
  your password. Note that the character that separates the 
  old and the new password is a colon ':' to allow passwords 
  containing space characters to be changed. 
  NOTE by marvin 
  All passwords are encrypted before they are saved to the database. 
  That means that if you forget your password there is no way for 
  me to recover it. Unless you can prove (you can't) that you are the 
  owner of an account I will not change the password and send you 
  a new one. So, please make sure that you remember your password.

NAME 
  pip - Display pip count 
SYNOPSIS 
  pip 
DESCRIPTION 
  With the pip command you can see your and your opponent's pipcount. 
  For those who don't know what 'pipcount' means: it's the total amount 
  of points you have to move your pieces to bear them all off. 
  This command can only be used if both players have set their 'allowpip' 
  toggle to YES (that's the default). Type 'toggle allowpip' if you think 
  that using a computer to compute the pipcount is not fair. 
  This command can also be used while watching a game if both players 
  have set their allowpip-toggle to YES.

  toggle, toggle-allowpip
  
NAME 
  raccoon - Offering an instant redouble that is a raccoon 
SYNOPSIS 
  beaver 
DESCRIPTION 
  An instant redouble of an offered "beaver" is called "raccoon". You can 
  use the command 'redouble' instead. 'raccoon' can only used for the 
  second instant redouble while 'redouble' can be used for any of several 
  instant redoubles in a row.

NAME 
  ratings - Display information from the rating list 
SYNOPSIS 
  ratings [<name |all] [from <number ] [to <number>] 
DESCRIPTION 
  You'll see the first 20 entries of the current rating list if you just 
  type 'ratings'. You can see the ratings of all players that are currently 
  logged in with the who command. To see the ratings of a player called 
  <name type 'ratings <name '. To see all the ratings type 'ratings>all'. 
  The optional 'from <number ' and 'to <number ' arguments override the>
  default positions 'from 1 to 20' for the rating list output. 
  Every player starts with a rating of 1500 points and an experience of 0. 
  Every match you play (except unlimited matches) changes your rating. If 
  your experience is greater than 50 you'll appear in the rating list. 
  To see how rating changes are calculated type 'help formula'. To see a 
  brief calculation of the rating change after a match make sure that your 
  ratings toggle is set to YES. 
  ETHICS 
  There are several ways to manipulate the rating list and get a high rating. 
  This is cheating and not fair. Until there is a way to prevent cheating 
  the sysop will erase accounts that have been manipulated.

  formula, names, toggle, toggle-ratings, who
  
NAME 
DESCRIPTION 
  If the rawboard toggle is set to yes you won't see the text representation 
  of the board but a number of tokens separated by colons. The tokens sent

  word 'board'): (tokens marked with + are new) 
  + name - the player's name 
  name - the opponent's name 
  match length - match length or 9999 for unlimited matches 
  player got - player's points in the match so far 
  opponent got - opponent's points in the match so far

  represent O's pieces negative numbers represent X's pieces 
  turn - -1 if it's X's turn, +1 if it's O's turn 
  dice - 2 numbers giving the player's dice. If it's the players 
  turn and she or he hasn't rolled, yet both numbers are 0 
  + dice - the opponent's dice (2 numbers) 
  cube - the number on the doubling cube 
  may double - 1 if player is allowed to double, 0 otherwise 
  + may double - the same for the opponent 
  was doubled - 1 if your opponent has just doubled, 0 otherwise

NAME 
  rawwho - who command for client programs 
SYNOPSIS 
  rawwho <same arguments as the who command>
DESCRIPTION 
  The 'rawwho' command produces almost the same output as the 'who' 
  command. The main difference is that the output is easier to parse 
  by client programs. For that purpose the following differences to 
  the output of the normal 'who' command exist: 
  - No title line is sent. 
  - each line representing a user starts with the text 'who: '. 
  - the status field contains the character '-' (minus) for each field 
  that the normal who output shows as a ' ' (blank). 
  - player names are not truncated. 
  - The text 'who:end' is sent as the last line of the output. Note 
  that there is no ' ' (blank) between 'who:' and 'end'.

NAME 
  redouble - accepting doubles by redoubling 
SYNOPSIS 
  redouble 
  beaver 
  raccoon 
  otter 
DESCRIPTION 
  A "beaver" or an "instant redouble" is an unlimited match feature that 
  allows the receiving party of a double to accept it at twice the level 
  at which it was offered. A "raccoon" is an instant redouble of a beaver 
  and an "otter" is an instant redouble of a raccoon. There are no special 
  names for further redoubles. Each of the redoubles can be accepted or 
  rejected the same way normal doubles are accepted or rejected. 
  The maximum number of instant redoubles in a row is the minimum of both 
  players' 'redoubles' variable. This variable is initially set to 0 but 
  it can be changed with the 'set' command. 
  The commands 'beaver', 'raccoon' and 'otter' are only allowed if the 
  redouble really is a beaver, raccoon or otter. The command 'redouble' 
  can be used for either of them and for further redoubles. 
SEE ALSO 
  accept, double, reject, set
  
NAME 
  reject 
SYNOPSIS 
  reject 
DESCRIPTION 
  You can use the reject command if your opponent has doubled and you don't 
  think you should accept the double. Use 'accept' if you do. 
  You can also use this command if your opponent wants to resign and you 
  don't agree with the number of points you'll win if you accept. 
SEE ALSO

NAME 
  resign - resign a game 
SYNOPSIS 
  resign <how>
DESCRIPTION 
  You can type 'resign <how ' if you want to resign. Your opponent will be>
  asked to accept or reject your resign. The number of points you lose 
  is determined by <how . You can give the following values of <how>: 
  normal - You'll lose the number of points on the cube. 
  gammon - You'll lose twice the number of points on the cube. 
  backgammon - You'll lose three times the number of points on the cube. 
  You can use 'n', 'g' and 'b' instead of 'normal', 'gammon' and 'backgammon'.

NAME 
  roll - roll the dice 
SYNOPSIS 
  roll 
DESCRIPTION 
  With the roll command you tell the server to roll the dice for you. 
  The server program then tells you the two numbers it rolled for 
  you and how many pieces you have to move. If you are not allowed to 
  double because you don't own the cube or the crawford rule applies 
  the server will roll for you automatically. If you set your double 
  toggle to NO the server will roll for you even if you were allowed to 
  double instead. 
  'roll' can be abbreviated by typing 'r'.

SYNOPSIS 
  help ruleX 
DESCRIPTION 
  Type 'help ruleX' to see rule X. Currently X can be a number between 1 
  and 9. The rules are: 
  These are not the 'official' rules word for word but my version of them. 
  They should say pretty much the same as the official rules. I left out 
  some rules that have no meaning for the server (like: what happens if you 
  roll the dice before your opponent has finished her or his move - the 
  server simply doesn't allow this). Currently there are no rules for 
  matches here. They will be added later. 
SEE ALSO 
  rule1, ..., rule9
  
NAME 
  rule1 - how the board looks like 
DESCRIPTION 
  Backgammon is a two player game. It's played with 2 dice and 15 pieces 
  for each player on a board with 24 positions and a field called the bar. 
  Before the game starts the pieces are placed on the board like this: 
  +-24-23-22-21-20-19-------18-17-16-15-14-13-+ 
  | X O | | O X |

NAME 
  rule2 - the direction you move pieces 
DESCRIPTION 
  (refer to the board shown in rule 1 for the numbers of the positions) 
  One of the players (O) moves her or his pieces from position 1 to position 
  in rule 1 you would move the X pieces from 24 to 1. The last six positions 
  for each player (1-6 for O and 19-24 for X) are called the player's home 
  the home board is on the left of the board from X's point of view and on 
  the right from O's point of view. The server always shows a 'v' on one side 
  of the board indicating the direction of your moves.
  
NAME 
  rule3 - the goal of the game 
DESCRIPTION 
  When you have moved all of your pieces into your home board you can bear 
  them off (remove them from the board according to the numbers on the dice). 
  The winner of a game is the first player who succeeds in bearing of all 
  own pieces from the board.
  
NAME 
  rule4 - rolling the dice 
DESCRIPTION 
  At the beginning of a game each player rolls with a single die. If both 
  players roll the same number they have to roll again. The player who 
  finally rolls the higher number makes the first move using the two numbers 
  just rolled. After the opening roll both players roll alternating using 
  two dice.
  
NAME 
  rule5 - moving pieces 
DESCRIPTION 
  After rolling the dice you have to move pieces. Moving pieces means either: 
  - moving one or more pieces on the board. You move the number of positions 
  according to the number of the dice. E.g: if one of the dice shows the 
  number 4 you can move one of your pieces 4 positions in your direction. 
  If you move one piece with both numbers on the dice this is considered 
  being two separate moves. 
  - entering one or more pieces from the bar into your opponent's home board 
  according to the numbers on the dice. E.g.: if one of the dice shows the 
  number 4 you can enter one piece from the bar to position 4 or 21 
  (depending on where your opponent's home board is). 
  - bearing off pieces from the the board if none of your pieces is on the 
  bar or outside your home board. (see rule 7 for details)
  
NAME 
  rule6 - moving pieces 
DESCRIPTION 
  a. If you roll a double the number on the dice is used four times to 
  move a piece. 
  a. You have to use both (all) numbers on the dice if possible. You can use 
  any of the numbers first. If you can use either of the numbers but not 
  both, you have to use the higher one for moving one piece. 
  b. It's not allowed to move a piece to a position occupied by two or 
  more pieces of your opponent. 
  c. If you move a piece to a position occupied by a single piece (blot) 
  of your opponent, this piece is removed from the board and placed on 
  the bar. This piece can later be re-entered into your home board according 
  to rule 5. 
  d. If one of your pieces is on the bar, you are not allowed to move 
  pieces on the board before the piece on the bar has been re-entered.
  
NAME 
  rule7 - bearing off pieces 
DESCRIPTION 
  When you are allowed to bear off pieces (rule 5) you can bear off a piece 
  from a position matching the number on a die (e.g. 5 or 20 if you have 
  rolled a 5) or a piece from the highest occupied position smaller than 
  the number on the die. If you roll a number matching an unoccupied 
  position you are not allowed to bear off pieces from smaller positions if 
  there are any pieces on higher positions. You have to move one of the 
  pieces on the higher positions in this case. You are not forced to bear 
  off pieces if it is also possible to move pieces inside your home board and 
  rule 6 is not violated.
  
NAME 
  rule8 - winning 
DESCRIPTION 
  The value of a game is the number of points the winner gains at the end of 
  the game. This value is initially 1. 
  The player who bears off all her or his pieces first is the winner of the 
  game and wins the value of that game. If you win and your opponent couldn't 
  bear off any piece the value of the game is doubled (this is called 
  winning a 'gammon'). 
  You win a 'backgammon' if your opponent couldn't bear off any piece and one 
  or more of her or his pieces are still on the bar or inside your home
  
NAME 
  rule9 - doubling 
DESCRIPTION 
  Any player may offer to double the value of a game. After the first double 
  the right to offer the next one alternates between the two players. The 
  player who has accepted the last double is the one who is allowed to offer 
  the next one. You may offer a double when it's your turn to roll but you 
  haven't rolled yet. An offered double can be accepted or rejected (declined). 
  If a double is declined the game is over and the player who has offered the 
  double wins the value of the game before the double was offered. 
  If a player wins a gammon or a backgammon the value of the game as deter- 
  mined by previous doubling is multiplied by 2 or 3 (see rule 8).

  The number of shouts is limited for newcomers. This is a Backgammon 
  server. If you want to talk to lots of people rather than play 
  Backgammon please use IRC (ask your system administrator how to 
  use IRC). If your message is directed to one person only, you should 
  use the 'tell' command.

  	 If one of your opponents in those matches is currently logged 
  	 in, you'll see an asterisk '*' before his or her name. 
  	 If your opponent is logged in and ready for a match you'll 
  	 see two asterisks in front of the name. 
  'show savedcount [player]' shows you how many saved games a player has. 
  	 If you don't specify a player name, it gives you your own. 
  	 This is an accurate count, and should be the same as what the 
  	 player sees with 'show saved'. 
  	 (Note: this is beta, and could be removed.) 
  'show watchers' tells you who is watching who. 
  'show max' displays the maximum of simultaneous users.

NAME 
  tinyfugue - a few hints on using the TinyFugue client 
DESCRIPTION 
  o get it by ftp: from ferkel.ucsb.edu pub/mud/Clients/tf.2.1.beta2.tar.z 
  NEW: An improved version that uses a separate window to display the 
  backgammon board is available now by ftp from 
  figment.csee.usf.edu in directory pub/misc/FIBS_client 
  Use the patch file to update from the original client or get 
  the file tf.2.1.beta2.fibs.tar.z for the whole package. 
  o unpack it using the gunzip and the tar program. 
  o read the documentation that comes with TinyFugue. (esp. INSTALLATION) 
  o edit the Makefile if necessary. I had to replace -DTERMCAP by -DHARDCODE 
  in the FLAGS=... line near the top of it. Try this if the program tells 
  you it can't use visual mode when you run it. 
  o type 'make install' 
  o create a file called .tfrc in your home directory containing the lines: 
  /visual on 
  /addworld FIBS your_login_name your_password 129.16.235.90 4321 
  (leave out name _and_ password if you don't like plain passwords on disk) 
  (o make sure others can't read the file: chmod 600 .tfrc) 
  o run the client 
  o If you have problems using it, type the client's /help command. 
  That's as much help as I can give. PLEASE don't send mail to me about 
  problems with it. It worked for me and all I wanted to do is showing you 
  that MUD clients can be used (and maybe expanded) for FIBS.
