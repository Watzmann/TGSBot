| known bugs:   1) greedy bearoff does not work correctly, better    |
|                  not use it.                                       |
|               2) calculation of possible moves still fails in      |
|                  some cases. Don't use automove.                   |
|               3) tigergammon_bots fall dead after cube actions,    |
|                  better just play 1-pointers                       |
|                                                                    |
| fixed:           "in some cases, clients don't show the dice."     |
|                                                                    |
| new:                                                               |
|               1) watch, unwatch, look, time, set timezone          |
|               2) kibitz, whisper                                   |
|               3) show saved, savedcount, watchers                  |
|               4) save/resume games                                 |
|               5) bots :)                                           |
|                                                                    |
