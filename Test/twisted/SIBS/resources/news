| known bugs:   1) greedy bearoff does not work correctly, better    |
|                  not use it.                                       |
|               2) calculation of possible moves still fails in      |
|                  some cases. Don't use automove.                   |
|               3) tigergammon_bots fall dead after cube actions,    |
|                  better just play 1-pointers                       |
|               4) tigergammon_bots get lost every once in a while,  |
|                  most likely those games are corrupt, then.        |
|                                                                    |
| currently working on:         1, 4                                 |
|                                                                    |
| 4) mostly fixed                                                    |
